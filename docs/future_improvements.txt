Ideas for future improvements / additional features.

1. Standardise power demand profile timespans.
	- Create standards for year / month / day in hourly steps.
	- All subsystems that generate / use power demand must be adapted.
	- This is so that the mini-grid can be designed based on different
	  power demand profiles. Or power demand profiles can be repeated
	  to create profiles that cover a longer timespan.
	
	Example: customer demand profiles cover 24hrs. The mini-grid is
	  designed based on a full year and solar power is retrieved for a 
	  full year too. This means that the standard profile for the design
	  process should be a year, so the 24hr demand profile should be 
	  repeated 365 in order to cover a full year. It would be useful to
	  to have a toggle for the profile type and have all the subsystems
	  respect it.

2. Optimise performance of generation sizer (gensizer.py).
	- The PSO algorithm could be faster. As of right now it is written
	  with many for loops inside, which are quite slow in Python. It may
	  be worth refactoring the way in which particle velocities and 
	  positions are handled.
	- Probably a smart idea to use numpy and vectorised operations instead
	  of lists and for loops.
